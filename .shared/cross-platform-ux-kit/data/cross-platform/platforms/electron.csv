No,Category,Guideline,Description,Do,Don't,Platform Notes
1,Window,Match native window chrome,Window should feel native to the OS,Use titleBarStyle hiddenInset on macOS hidden on Windows,Use web-style window decorations,Platform-specific window styling required
2,Window,Implement proper drag regions,Titlebar areas must be draggable,-webkit-app-region: drag on titlebar -webkit-app-region: no-drag on buttons,Forget drag regions making window immovable,Drag regions required for frameless windows
3,Window,Remember window state,Position and size should persist across sessions,Save bounds on resize/move restore on launch validate visible,Start with fixed size every time lose position,Use electron-store or similar for persistence
4,Window,Handle multi-display correctly,Window should appear on valid display,Check if saved position is visible on current display setup,Restore to position that's now off-screen,screen.getDisplayMatching for validation
5,Keyboard,Use platform-correct shortcuts,Shortcuts should match OS conventions,Cmd on macOS Ctrl on Windows for primary shortcuts,Same shortcuts across all platforms,CmdOrCtrl+ for cross-platform accelerators
6,Keyboard,Register global shortcuts,Some shortcuts should work app-wide,globalShortcut.register for app-wide hotkeys,Only use in-page shortcuts,Unregister on app quit to free shortcuts
7,Keyboard,Support system shortcuts,Standard shortcuts must work,Cmd+C Cmd+V Cmd+Q should work as expected,Override system shortcuts for other purposes,role-based menu items handle standard shortcuts
8,Menu,Create proper application menu,App menu is expected on desktop,Menu.setApplicationMenu with proper structure,Skip application menu entirely,macOS requires app menu Windows optional
9,Menu,Use menu item roles,Leverage built-in menu behaviors,Use role: copy paste quit etc for standard items,Manually implement standard menu behaviors,Roles handle accessibility and proper behavior
10,Menu,Implement context menus,Right-click should show relevant actions,menu.popup() on contextmenu event context-aware items,No context menu or single global menu,Different menus based on clicked element
11,Tray,Create system tray icon,Tray provides background access,Tray icon with context menu for common actions,Skip tray icon for background apps,Template images on macOS for menu bar style
12,Tray,Handle tray interactions correctly,Click behavior differs by platform,Click to toggle window right-click for menu on macOS,Same behavior on all platforms,macOS: click=window Windows: click=menu typically
13,Dialog,Use native dialogs,Dialogs should match OS appearance,dialog.showOpenDialog showSaveDialog showMessageBox,Custom HTML dialogs for system operations,Native dialogs feel more trustworthy
14,Dialog,Parent dialogs to windows,Dialogs should be modal to window,Pass parentWindow to dialog methods,Floating dialogs that can get lost behind app,Modal attachment prevents window confusion
15,Files,Handle file associations,App should open associated files,Register file types in package.json open-file event,Ignore file drops and associations,Build configuration for file associations
16,Files,Implement drag and drop,Files should be droppable into app,Handle dragover drop events process files correctly,Web-only drag implementation missing native feel,Native file paths available in drop event
17,Security,Enable context isolation,Renderer must be isolated from Node,contextIsolation: true sandbox: true in webPreferences,contextIsolation: false nodeIntegration: true,Security best practice required for modern Electron
18,Security,Use contextBridge,Expose minimal API to renderer,contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld with specific functions,Expose entire node modules to renderer,Type-safe preload API recommended
19,Security,Validate IPC channels,Only handle expected channels,Whitelist valid channels in preload script,Accept any channel from renderer,Channel validation prevents injection
20,Updates,Implement auto-updates,App should update automatically,electron-updater with proper signing and server,Manual updates only requiring download,Code signing required for auto-update
21,Updates,Handle update lifecycle,Updates should not interrupt work,Notify when update ready install on restart,Force restart immediately on update download,Update-downloaded event for user choice
22,Performance,Lazy load main process,Reduce startup time,Dynamic require for modules not needed at startup,Import everything at top of main process,Startup time critical for desktop apps
23,Performance,Optimize renderer memory,Long-running app accumulates memory,Clean up listeners remove references on view change,Memory leaks from unremoved listeners,DevTools Memory tab for leak detection
24,Performance,Use native modules carefully,Native modules affect startup and compatibility,Prefer pure JS alternatives lazy load native modules,Require heavy native modules synchronously,node-gyp rebuild for each Electron version
25,IPC,Use invoke/handle pattern,Async IPC with proper error handling,ipcRenderer.invoke + ipcMain.handle for request-response,send/on for everything including async,Invoke/handle provides Promise-based API
26,IPC,Batch IPC operations,Reduce IPC overhead,Send batched data in single IPC call,Many sequential IPC calls for related operations,IPC has overhead per call
27,Storage,Use correct data paths,Store data in platform-appropriate location,app.getPath userData for user data documents etc,Hardcoded paths or app directory,Platform-specific paths handled automatically
28,Storage,Choose appropriate storage,Different data needs different storage,electron-store for settings SQLite for structured data,localStorage for everything,localStorage 5MB limit not suitable for all data
29,Notifications,Use native notifications,Notifications should match OS style,new Notification with title body icon,Web notification API only,Native notifications support actions and replies
30,Accessibility,Test with screen readers,Desktop screen readers must work,Test with VoiceOver NVDA JAWS,Assume web a11y is sufficient,Desktop screen readers have different behaviors
