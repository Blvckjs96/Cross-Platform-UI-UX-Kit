No,Category,Guideline,Description,Do,Don't,Platform Notes
1,Widgets,Everything is a widget,Flutter composes UI from widget tree,Build widget trees with composition,Imperative UI updates like other frameworks,Stateless and Stateful widgets
2,Widgets,Choose correct widget type,StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget matters,StatelessWidget for pure presentation Stateful when local state needed,StatefulWidget for everything,Consider if state can live in parent instead
3,Widgets,Use const constructors,Const widgets are more efficient,const keyword for immutable widgets,Create new widget instances unnecessarily,Const constructors prevent rebuild when parent rebuilds
4,Layout,Master layout widgets,Core layout widgets for all UI,Column Row Stack Padding Container Expanded Flexible,Nested Containers for layout,SizedBox for spacing more efficient than Container
5,Layout,Understand constraints,Constraints flow down sizes flow up,Parent provides constraints child picks size in constraints,Fight constraint system with unbounded widgets,Flexible and Expanded resolve unbounded issues
6,Layout,Handle overflow,Content may exceed available space,SingleChildScrollView or ListView for scrollable,Unbounded Column in Column causing RenderFlex overflow,Wrap in scrollable or constrain size
7,Navigation,Use Navigator 2.0,Declarative navigation with Router,GoRouter or auto_route for declarative navigation,Navigator.push only for simple apps,Deep linking requires declarative approach
8,Navigation,Handle back button,Android back button must work,WillPopScope or PopScope for intercept,Ignore back button handling,iOS swipe back handled by CupertinoPageRoute
9,Navigation,Pass data through routes,Routes need data passing,Constructor parameters or route arguments,Global state for route-specific data,Typed route parameters with code generation
10,State,Choose state solution,State management affects architecture,Provider Riverpod or Bloc for app state setState for local,Prop drilling or global variables,setState fine for widget-local ephemeral state
11,State,Handle async state,Loading error and data states,AsyncValue or similar for async data FutureBuilder,Unhandled loading and error states,ConnectionState for FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder
12,State,Dispose resources,Controllers and streams need cleanup,dispose() method to clean up controllers subscriptions,Memory leaks from undisposed resources,initState and dispose lifecycle pair
13,Theming,Use ThemeData,Centralized theme configuration,ThemeData with colorScheme textTheme,Hardcoded colors and styles,ColorScheme for Material 3 colors
14,Theming,Support dark mode,App should respond to system theme,ThemeMode.system with light and dark ThemeData,Single theme ignoring preference,MediaQuery.platformBrightnessOf for detection
15,Theming,Material vs Cupertino,Match platform design language,MaterialApp for Android CupertinoApp for iOS,Material widgets on iOS or vice versa,Platform-adaptive widgets available
16,Lists,Use ListView.builder,Builder for efficient long lists,ListView.builder for dynamic lists,ListView with children for long lists,itemCount and itemBuilder for virtualization
17,Lists,Optimize list items,List items affect scroll performance,const widgets RepaintBoundary for complex items,Heavy build in itemBuilder,cacheExtent for prefetch tuning
18,Animation,Use implicit animations,AnimatedFoo widgets for simple cases,AnimatedContainer AnimatedOpacity for automatic animation,AnimationController for simple property changes,Implicit animations handle duration and curve
19,Animation,AnimationController for control,Explicit control when needed,AnimationController with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin,Implicit animations when you need control,dispose controller to prevent memory leaks
20,Animation,Hero for shared element,Shared element transitions between routes,Hero widget with matching tag on both routes,Manual coordinate-based shared transitions,Hero requires same tag and Navigator transition
21,Performance,const widgets,Const prevents unnecessary rebuilds,const constructor and const keyword,Rebuilding widgets that haven't changed,Linter rule prefer_const_constructors
22,Performance,Keys for identity,Keys preserve state during reorder,Key on stateful list items,Relying on index when items reorder,ValueKey ObjectKey UniqueKey types
23,Performance,Profile with DevTools,Measure before optimizing,Flutter DevTools for performance profiling,Guessing at performance issues,Profile release mode not debug
24,Platform,Platform-aware UI,UI should match platform expectations,Platform.isIOS .isAndroid for platform checks,Identical UI on all platforms,PlatformWidget pattern for abstraction
25,Platform,Use platform channels,Native code integration when needed,MethodChannel for platform-specific features,Pure Dart when native API needed,Pigeon for type-safe code generation
26,Accessibility,Semantic widgets,Screen readers need semantic tree,Semantics widget with label hint,Inaccessible custom paint or gestures,SemanticLabel for Image and Icon
27,Accessibility,Test with screen reader,TalkBack and VoiceOver testing,Enable screen reader test full flows,Assume default accessibility sufficient,Semantic ordering and grouping
28,Text,Handle text scaling,System text size settings respected,textScaleFactor considered in layout,Fixed heights that break with large text,MediaQuery.textScaleFactorOf for checks
29,Text,Rich text and styling,Text styling options,TextSpan for inline styling Text.rich for mixed,Many Text widgets for single styled text,DefaultTextStyle for subtree styling
30,Testing,Widget testing,Test widgets in isolation,testWidgets for widget tests find.byType,Only integration tests or no tests,WidgetTester pumpWidget and interactions
