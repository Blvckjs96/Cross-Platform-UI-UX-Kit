No,Category,Guideline,Description,Do,Don't,Platform Notes
1,Components,Use native components,Native components perform better than JS views,Pressable TouchableOpacity FlatList SectionList,View with onPress (not pressable) map for lists,Native components have platform-specific behaviors
2,Components,Platform-specific components,Some components are platform-specific,Platform.select or .ios.js .android.js files,Same component regardless of platform differences,StatusBar DatePickerIOS/Android differ by platform
3,Lists,Use FlatList for performance,FlatList virtualizes long lists,FlatList with keyExtractor renderItem,ScrollView with map for long lists,VirtualizedList for custom implementations
4,Lists,Optimize list rendering,Lists are common performance bottleneck,getItemLayout for fixed heights removeClippedSubviews,Heavy renderItem components complex keys,memo for list items to prevent re-renders
5,Navigation,Use React Navigation,Standard navigation library for React Native,@react-navigation/native with stack drawer bottom-tabs,Custom navigation implementation,React Navigation 6+ with native screens
6,Navigation,Handle gestures correctly,iOS and Android have different back gestures,gestureEnabled iOS swipe back Android system back,Disable gestures without alternative,BackHandler for Android hardware back
7,Navigation,Deep link support,App should handle incoming URLs,Linking API and navigation linking config,Ignore deep links to app,Universal links and app links configuration
8,Styles,Use StyleSheet.create,StyleSheet provides optimization,StyleSheet.create for style definitions,Inline style objects recreated each render,Styles are frozen at creation for performance
9,Styles,Handle platform differences,iOS and Android have different defaults,Platform.select for platform-specific styles,Single style assuming cross-platform identical,Shadows: iOS shadowX Android elevation
10,Styles,Support dark mode,App should respond to system appearance,useColorScheme hook Appearance API,Hardcoded light mode only,Appearance.addChangeListener for updates
11,Layout,Flexbox as layout model,React Native uses flexbox exclusively,flexDirection alignItems justifyContent flex,Web CSS properties that don't exist,Default flexDirection is column not row
12,Layout,Handle safe areas,Content must not overlap notch or home indicator,SafeAreaView or react-native-safe-area-context,Fixed padding assuming no safe areas,useSafeAreaInsets for granular control
13,Layout,Support different screen sizes,Many Android screen sizes exist,Dimensions API or useWindowDimensions,Fixed pixel values for all screens,PixelRatio for device-specific adjustments
14,Animation,Use Native Driver,Native driver offloads to UI thread,useNativeDriver: true for transform opacity,Animating layout properties with native driver,Layout animations require JS thread
15,Animation,Reanimated for complex animation,react-native-reanimated for performant animations,useSharedValue useAnimatedStyle for 60fps,Animated API for complex gesture-driven animation,Reanimated 2+ with worklets for performance
16,Animation,LayoutAnimation for simple cases,LayoutAnimation for auto-layout changes,LayoutAnimation.configureNext before state change,Complex manual animations for list changes,Android requires UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental
17,Gestures,Use gesture handler,react-native-gesture-handler for gestures,GestureDetector Pan Tap LongPress handlers,Basic touch responder system,Gesture handler works on UI thread
18,Gestures,Handle scroll interactions,Gestures and scroll can conflict,simultaneousHandlers and waitFor gesture coordination,Gestures blocking scroll or vice versa,Gesture composition for complex interactions
19,Images,Optimize image loading,Images affect performance significantly,FastImage library cached network images,Image without caching or size optimization,Resize images to display size on server
20,Images,Handle image failures,Network images can fail to load,onError handler defaultSource fallback,Silent failure on image load error,Placeholder or fallback for failed loads
21,Storage,Use AsyncStorage carefully,AsyncStorage is string-based,AsyncStorage for simple data MMKV for performance,Large objects or frequent writes to AsyncStorage,MMKV or WatermelonDB for heavy storage needs
22,Storage,Handle storage errors,Storage operations can fail,try-catch around all storage operations,Assume storage always succeeds,Fallback behavior for storage failures
23,Performance,Avoid anonymous functions in props,New function reference causes re-render,useCallback for event handlers,onPress={() => handlePress(id)},Memoized callbacks or class methods
24,Performance,Use memo strategically,memo prevents unnecessary re-renders,React.memo for pure functional components,memo everything without measurement,Profile before optimizing components
25,Accessibility,Support screen readers,VoiceOver and TalkBack must work,accessible accessibilityLabel accessibilityHint,Inaccessible custom components,accessibilityRole for semantic meaning
26,Accessibility,Handle accessibility focus,Focus management for screen readers,accessibilityViewIsModal setAccessibilityFocus,Modal content not properly focused,Focus trap for modal dialogs
27,Text,Use Text for all text,Text component required for text rendering,Text component for all text content,Bare strings or text in View,Nesting Text for inline styles
28,Text,Handle text scaling,System text size settings must be respected,allowFontScaling for text consider max scale,Fixed text sizes ignoring accessibility,maxFontSizeMultiplier for constrained areas
29,Platform,Test on real devices,Simulators don't catch all issues,Test on physical iOS and Android devices,Simulator-only testing,Performance differs significantly on real devices
30,Bridge,Minimize bridge traffic,JS-native communication has overhead,Batch updates reduce bridge calls,High-frequency updates across bridge,New Architecture Fabric and TurboModules improve this
