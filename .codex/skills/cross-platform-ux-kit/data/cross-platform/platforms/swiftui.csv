No,Category,Guideline,Description,Do,Don't,Platform Notes
1,Layout,Use native layout system,SwiftUI provides powerful layout primitives,VStack HStack ZStack with alignment and spacing,UIKit-style frame calculations for layout,GeometryReader only when absolutely necessary
2,Layout,Respect safe areas,Content should not overlap system UI,SafeAreaInset for custom safe area handling,ignoresSafeArea without consideration,.safeAreaInset modifier for custom elements
3,Layout,Use adaptive layouts,UI should adapt to device and orientation,ViewThatFits for adaptive content AnyLayout for dynamic,Fixed layouts that break on different devices,@Environment horizontalSizeClass for adaptation
4,Navigation,Use NavigationStack,Modern navigation with path-based routing,NavigationStack with navigationDestination and path,Deprecated NavigationView or custom navigation,iOS 16+ NavigationStack is preferred
5,Navigation,Handle deep linking,App should respond to URLs,onOpenURL modifier handle URL and navigate,Ignore incoming URLs,Universal Links and custom URL schemes
6,Navigation,Support navigation gestures,iOS users expect gesture navigation,Allow system back swipe gesture,navigationBarBackButtonHidden without custom gesture,Interactive dismiss gesture on sheets
7,Components,Use SF Symbols,Native icons that adapt to context,Image(systemName:) with symbol variants and rendering,Third-party icon libraries for system-style icons,2500+ symbols scale with Dynamic Type
8,Components,Support Dynamic Type,Text should scale with user preference,@ScaledMetric for custom sizes Text scales automatically,Fixed font sizes ignoring accessibility,Test with largest accessibility text sizes
9,Components,Use semantic colors,Colors should adapt to appearance,Color.primary Color.secondary Color.accentColor,Hardcoded colors that don't adapt,Asset catalog colors for custom with dark variant
10,State,Understand property wrappers,Choose correct wrapper for state type,@State for local @Binding for passed @StateObject for reference,@State for reference types wrong wrapper choice,@ObservedObject for passed reference types
11,State,Minimize view invalidation,Views rebuild when state changes,Keep state at lowest possible level in view hierarchy,All state at root causing full tree rebuild,@Observable macro in iOS 17+ for granular updates
12,Gestures,Implement platform gestures,iOS users expect specific gestures,SwipeActions for list items DragGesture for custom,Non-standard gestures for common actions,Long press for context menu swipe for actions
13,Gestures,Support simultaneous gestures,Multiple gestures may be active,simultaneousGesture for combined gesture handling,Blocking gestures that prevent standard interactions,Gesture priorities and coordination
14,Animation,Use implicit animations,SwiftUI handles animation automatically,.animation modifier withAnimation block for implicit,Manual animation controllers like UIKit,Animation modifier after the value that changes
15,Animation,Match platform animation,iOS has specific animation curves,.spring for interactive .easeInOut for transitions,Linear animations that feel mechanical,MatchedGeometryEffect for hero transitions
16,Lists,Use List for scrolling content,List provides native styling and behavior,List with ForEach NavigationLink for navigation,ScrollView with VStack for long lists,List has built-in swipe actions sections refresh
17,Lists,Implement swipe actions,List items should have quick actions,.swipeActions modifier for leading/trailing actions,Buttons inside row for all actions,Destructive actions should require confirmation
18,Forms,Use Form for settings,Form provides grouped appearance,Form with Section headers and footers,Plain VStack for settings screens,Form adapts to platform (iPhone vs iPad vs Mac)
19,Forms,Handle keyboard properly,Keyboard should not obscure inputs,.scrollDismissesKeyboard modifier keyboard avoidance,Keyboard covering input fields,FocusState for programmatic focus control
20,Sheets,Use sheets for modal content,.sheet for modal presentation,.sheet .fullScreenCover for modal content,NavigationLink to modal screens,.presentationDetents for resizable sheets iOS 16+
21,Sheets,Support dismiss gestures,Sheets should be swipe dismissable,Allow interactive dismiss handle onDismiss,Prevent dismiss without confirmation when needed,interactiveDismissDisabled for unsaved changes
22,Menus,Use context menus,Long press shows context actions,.contextMenu modifier with Button actions,Custom popup menus reimplementing context menu,System context menu matches platform conventions
23,Menus,Implement toolbar menus,.toolbar for navigation bar actions,.toolbar with ToolbarItem placements,Custom navigation bar implementations,Placement adapts to platform and context
24,Accessibility,Support VoiceOver,Screen reader must work correctly,.accessibilityLabel .accessibilityHint modifiers,Inaccessible custom components,Test by enabling VoiceOver in Settings
25,Accessibility,Implement accessibility actions,.accessibilityAction for custom actions,.accessibilityAction for non-obvious interactions,Custom gestures without accessibility alternative,Magic tap double-tap gestures for accessibility
26,Performance,Avoid expensive view bodies,View body called frequently,Keep body computation fast move work outside,Heavy computation in view body,Computed properties for cached values
27,Performance,Use task modifier correctly,.task for async work on appear,.task with proper cancellation handling,.onAppear for async work without cancellation,.task cancels automatically on view disappear
28,Testing,Preview different states,Previews show different configurations,Multiple previews for states devices sizes,Single preview assuming one configuration,PreviewProvider with multiple configurations
29,Platform,Adapt for iPad and Mac,App may run on multiple Apple platforms,Environment checks for platform-specific UI,iPhone-only design on larger screens,Catalyst and designed for iPad considerations
30,Data,Use SwiftData or Core Data,Persistent storage has native solutions,SwiftData for iOS 17+ Core Data for older,UserDefaults for complex structured data,@Query for SwiftData integration with SwiftUI
