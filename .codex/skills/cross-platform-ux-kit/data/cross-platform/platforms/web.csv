No,Category,Guideline,Description,Do,Don't,Platform Notes
1,Responsive,Use mobile-first breakpoints,Start with mobile layout and enhance for larger screens,Design mobile layout first then add md: lg: xl: breakpoints,Start with desktop and try to shrink down,Tailwind: sm:640px md:768px lg:1024px xl:1280px 2xl:1536px
2,Responsive,Handle all viewport sizes,Content should be accessible at any width between breakpoints,Use fluid layouts with max-width containers and percentage widths,Only test at exact breakpoint values,Test at 320px (min mobile) to 2560px (4K)
3,Responsive,Optimize touch targets,Interactive elements must be large enough for touch on mobile,Minimum 44x44px touch targets on mobile (48x48px preferred),Use desktop-sized buttons on mobile without scaling,Use Tailwind h-11 w-11 minimum for touch
4,Navigation,Implement browser navigation,Back/forward buttons should work with app state,Use URL-based routing react-router or Next.js router,Build SPA that breaks browser navigation,History API or framework router required
5,Navigation,Support URL deep linking,Every view should have a shareable URL,Map routes to UI state use query params for filters,Store state only in memory or localStorage,Server-side rendering helps with SEO
6,Navigation,Handle scroll position,Scroll should restore when navigating back,Implement scroll restoration with router or ScrollRestoration,Always scroll to top on every navigation,Use scrollRestoration: 'auto' or manual control
7,Forms,Use native form elements,Leverage browser validation and accessibility,Use input type=email type=tel type=date for mobile keyboards,Build custom inputs without accessibility,Native inputs get free keyboard optimization
8,Forms,Handle form state properly,Forms should preserve state and show validation,Use react-hook-form or similar debounce validation show inline errors,Validate only on submit lose state on navigation,Controlled components with proper state management
9,Forms,Support autofill,Browser password managers and autofill should work,Use proper autocomplete attributes on inputs,Block or break autofill functionality,autocomplete=email autocomplete=current-password
10,Performance,Lazy load below fold,Only load what's visible initially,Use dynamic import() for routes and heavy components,Bundle everything in initial load,Next.js next/dynamic or React.lazy for code splitting
11,Performance,Optimize images,Images are usually the heaviest assets,Use next/image or srcset responsive images WebP format,Serve unoptimized full-size images to all devices,Lazy load images with loading=lazy attribute
12,Performance,Minimize layout shift,Content should not jump as page loads,Reserve space for dynamic content use aspect-ratio,Load content that shifts existing content,Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Core Web Vital
13,Accessibility,Keyboard navigation,All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible,Use semantic HTML test Tab/Enter/Escape flows,Rely on mouse-only interactions div as buttons,Focus visible styles required focus-visible:ring
14,Accessibility,Screen reader support,Content should be accessible to screen readers,Use proper heading hierarchy landmarks labels aria-,Visual-only content without text alternatives,Test with VoiceOver NVDA ChromeVox
15,Accessibility,Color contrast,Text must be readable against backgrounds,WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text 3:1 for large text,Light gray text on white backgrounds,Use contrast checker tools validate in dark mode too
16,Browser,Handle offline state,Gracefully handle network disconnection,Show offline indicator cache critical data retry on reconnect,Crash or hang when network unavailable,Service Worker for PWA offline support
17,Browser,Support print styles,Pages should print cleanly when needed,Use @media print to hide nav show content legibly,Ignore print stylesheets entirely,Hide navigation modals optimize layout for paper
18,Browser,Respect user preferences,Honor system and browser settings,Check prefers-reduced-motion prefers-color-scheme,Ignore accessibility preferences,CSS media queries for preference detection
19,Animation,Use transform and opacity,These properties are GPU accelerated,Animate transform and opacity avoid layout properties,Animate width height margin padding top left,will-change for complex animations
20,Animation,Respect reduced motion,Some users need minimal animation,@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) disable animations,Force animations on all users,Tailwind motion-reduce: variant
21,Layout,Use CSS Grid and Flexbox,Modern layout techniques are well supported,Grid for 2D layouts Flexbox for 1D alignment,Float-based layouts or tables for layout,Browser support is excellent (97%+)
22,Layout,Container queries for components,Components should adapt to container not viewport,Use @container queries for reusable component sizing,Media queries inside components that depend on page,container-type: inline-size on parent
23,State,URL as state source,Shareable filterable sortable states belong in URL,Put search filters sort order pagination in query params,Store list state only in React/Vue state,Use URL search params for list views
24,State,Handle loading states,Every async action needs loading indication,Show skeleton or spinner during data fetch,Jump straight from empty to loaded,React Suspense or manual loading state
25,SEO,Semantic HTML structure,Search engines parse HTML structure,Use h1-h6 nav main article section footer,div soup with no semantic meaning,One h1 per page proper heading hierarchy
26,SEO,Meta tags and Open Graph,Pages need proper meta for sharing,title description og:image og:title for social sharing,Generic or missing meta tags,Next.js Metadata API or react-helmet
27,Touch,Support touch gestures,Mobile users expect swipe and pinch,Implement swipe to dismiss pull to refresh where expected,Mouse-only interactions on touch devices,Touch events or gesture libraries
28,Touch,Prevent double-tap zoom,Buttons should respond immediately,Use touch-action: manipulation on interactive elements,Default double-tap delay on buttons,Meta viewport with user-scalable=no if appropriate
29,Scrolling,Smooth scroll behavior,Anchor links and scroll-to should animate,Use scroll-behavior: smooth or scrollIntoView with behavior,Jarring instant scroll jumps,CSS scroll-behavior or JS scrollIntoView
30,Scrolling,Handle sticky elements,Headers and sidebars often need to stick,Use position: sticky with proper top/bottom values,Fixed positioning that breaks scroll flow,Sticky works within scroll container limits
